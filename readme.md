Languator Frontend

- Design Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eob4KJWfJ8tiHT5_FGrDOypSCnBMrM40aLD9ENr_tu4/edit?usp=sharing

Todo:
- [x] solution tab
- [x] leaderboard tab
- [x] attempt tab
- [x] next problem button (with 'french' being the hardcoded language to get, for the time being)
- [x] submit button (only increment user's score when they have not viewed the 'solution' tab && their submission is correct)
- [x] make the mock data access not generate new records everytime the interval triggers, instead make the object stored its own collection of users (will make the mock more realistic)
- [x] notification popup
- [ ] next problem button - create an option to select from a list of languages which one you'll like the next problem to be 
- [ ] create mock backend
- [ ] create new data access implementations that use env variable that's setup to speak to your mock backend
- [ ] add scss
